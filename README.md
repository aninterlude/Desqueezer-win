# Desqueezer

**Desqueezer** is a Lightroom plugin that batch-applies an anamorphic desqueeze factor to selected DNG files by modifying their metadata using `exiftool`.

**❗Please note: This plugin irreversibly changes the metadata. Please backup your photos before use.**

**❗FORKED NOTE: There's no implemented checks. Sh version cut out. Logs are enabled to write in scripts directory (file recreates at every run)**

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the plugin, make sure the following setup steps are completed:

### 1. Install `exiftool`

This plugin uses `exiftool` to modify DNG metadata.  
Install it via winget:

```cmd
